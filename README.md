### Haii, I'm Primm

I'm a girl from the UK who enjoys programming in her spare time!!  
Here's a tiny bit about me:

📄 Currently my favourite (and most used) language is Rust, but I love writing in lots of languages!  
⚙️ I'm especially interested in old video games and low-level hardware.  
💾 I don't really have a theme for repos I keep here - they're just miscellaneous projects that I think people may be interested in.
