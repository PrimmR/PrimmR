### Haii, I'm Primm

I'm a girl from the UK who enjoys programming in her spare time!!  
Here's a tiny bit about me:

- Currently my favourite (and most used) language is Rust, but I love writing in lots of languages!
- I'm especially interested in old video games and low-level hardware. 
- I don't really have a theme for repos I put here, I just store any piece of code that I think people may be interested in, here.
